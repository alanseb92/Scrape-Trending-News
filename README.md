Most of the datasets that you find from different data sources on the internet are created by collecting data from websites. Using the GoogleNews API in Python, we can scrape trending updates based on any keyword or country.

The GoogleNews API can be used to scrape live news updates and the latest trends from around the world based on any topic. It allows you to retrieve information on any keyword which can be the name of any country, any event or even the name of a person who is trending on Google. If you have never used this API before, you can easily install it on your systems using the pip command; pip install googlenews.
